<h1>About This Project</h1>

<div class="item">
    <p>
        The Campus Lost & Found System is a simple, student-driven initiative
        created as a part of our **Design Thinking** project.  
        Our goal is to help students reclaim their lost belongings faster
        and reduce campus confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
        We built this platform using basic HTML & CSS to ensure it is easy,
        accessible, and maintainable by any student in the future.
